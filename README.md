Browser App Transitions
=======================

This is a demo of common app transitions in the browser.

There are 3 ways to approach these problems

1. View Transitions API
  - Only supported in chrome
2. Framer Motion
3. With raw (es2015) JS / CSS

Note that I will still be using React for the layout
